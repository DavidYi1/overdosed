# overdosed
What linguistic features are unique to discussions of nonmedical substance use?

### Background

 Social media (Twitter, Facebook, websites like CrazyMeds) can provide us with information on how the general population uses substances for nonmedical purposes. Social media may, in fact, provide a more accurate picture of usage than data from surveys or emergency rooms. Surveys ask a small sample of the population to remember (sometimes) illicit activities and report them to a federal authority under the promise of anonymynity. Emergency rooms only see the part of the story when substance use goes wrong.
