What linguistic features are unique to discussions of nonmedical substance use?

### Background

 Social media (Twitter, Facebook, websites like CrazyMeds) can provide us with information on how the general population uses substances for nonmedical purposes. Social media may, in fact, provide a more accurate picture of usage than data from surveys or emergency rooms.
